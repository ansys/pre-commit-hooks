This Ansys repository contains `pre-commit`_ hooks for different purposes.
Currently, these hooks are available:

* ``add-license-headers``: Add missing license headers to files by using
  `REUSE <https://reuse.software/>`_ . To use this hook, you must
  have ``REUSE`` implemented in your repository.

  #. Copy the .reuse directory from this repository into your repository.

     .. note::

        Configure .reuse/dep5 to match the file structure within your repository.
        The dep5 file contains files & directories that should not be given license headers.

        .reuse/templates/ansys.jinja2 contains the template for the license headers that are
        added to the files. If the content of the MIT license changes, replace the lines between
        the if statements in the following code block:

        .. code:: jinja

           {% if "MIT" in spdx_expressions %}
           ...
           {% endif %}

  #. Ensure your repository has the "src" directory.

     .. note::

        If the ``src`` directory does not exist, specify which directory should
        be checked for files missing license headers. To do so, add the args line
        to ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` in your repository:

        .. code:: yaml

           - repo: https://github.com/ansys/pre-commit-hooks
             rev: v0.1.0
             hooks:
             - id: add-license-headers
               args: ["--loc", "dir1,dir2", "--custom_copyright", "custom copyright phrase", "--custom_template", "template_name", "--custom_license", "license_name"]

        - ``dir1`` and ``dir2`` are directories containing files that are checked for license
          headers. By default, it looks for the ``src`` folder.
        - ``custom copyright phrase`` is the copyright line you want to include in the license
          header. By default, it uses ``"ANSYS, Inc. and/or its affiliates."``.
        - ``template_name`` is the name of the .jinja2 file located in ``.reuse/templates/``.
          By default, it uses ``ansys``.
        - ``license_name`` is the name of the license being used. For example, MIT, ECL-1.0, etc.
          To view a list of licenses that are supported by ``REUSE``, see
          https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/main/text. By default it uses ``MIT``.

        ``args`` can also be formatted as follows:

        .. code:: yaml

               args:
               - --loc=dir1,dir2
               - --custom_copyright=custom copyright phrase
               - --custom_template=template_name
               - --custom_license=license_name

How to install
--------------

The following sections provide instructions for installing the ``ansys-pre-commit-hooks``
package in two installation modes: user and developer.

For users
^^^^^^^^^

Before installing the package, to ensure that you
have the latest version of `pip`_, run this command:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install -U pip

Then, to install the package, run this command:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install ansys-pre-commit-hooks

For developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing the package in developer mode allows you to modify and
enhance the source code.

Before contributing to the project, ensure that you are familiar with
the `PyAnsys Developer's Guide`_.

For a developer installation, you must follow these steps:

#. Clone the repository with this command:

   .. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/ansys/pre-commit-hooks

#. Create a fresh-clean Python environment and activate it with these commands:

   .. code:: bash

      # Create a virtual environment
      python -m venv .venv

      # Activate it in a POSIX system
      source .venv/bin/activate

      # Activate it in Windows CMD environment
      .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

      # Activate it in Windows Powershell
      .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

#. Ensure that you have the latest required build system tools by
   running this command:

   .. code:: bash

      python -m pip install -U pip flit tox twine


#. Install the project in editable mode by running one of these commands:

   .. code:: bash

      # Install the minimum requirements
      python -m pip install -e .

      # Install the minimum + tests requirements
      python -m pip install -e .[tests]

      # Install the minimum + doc requirements
      python -m pip install -e .[doc]

      # Install all requirements
      python -m pip install -e .[tests,doc]

#. Verify your development installation by running this command:

   .. code:: bash

      tox


How to test it
--------------

This project takes advantage of `tox`_. This tool automates common
development tasks (similar to Makefile), but it is oriented towards
Python development.

Using ``tox``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While Makefile has rules, ``tox`` has environments. In fact, ``tox`` creates its
own virtual environment so that anything being tested is isolated from the project
to guarantee the project's integrity.

These environment commands are provided:

- **tox -e style**: Checks for coding style quality.
- **tox -e py**: Checks for unit tests.
- **tox -e py-coverage**: Checks for unit testing and code coverage.
- **tox -e doc**: Checks for successfully building the documentation.


Raw testing
^^^^^^^^^^^

If required, you can always call style commands, such as `black`_, `isort`_,
and `flake8`_, or unit testing commands, such as `pytest`_, from the command line.
However, calling these commands does not guarantee that your project is
being tested in an isolated environment, which is the reason why tools like
``tox`` exist.


A note on ``pre-commit``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The style checks take advantage of `pre-commit`_. Developers are not forced but
encouraged to install this tool by running this command:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install


Documentation
-------------

For building documentation, you can run the usual rules provided in the
`Sphinx`_ Makefile with a command that is formatted like this:

.. code:: bash

    make -C doc/ html && your_browser_name doc/html/index.html

However, the recommended way of checking documentation integrity is by
running ``tox`` with a command that is formatted like this:

.. code:: bash

    tox -e doc && your_browser_name .tox/doc_out/index.html


Distributing
------------

If you would like to create either source or wheel files, install
the building requirements and then execute the build module with these commands:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install .
    python -m build
    python -m twine check dist/*

This Ansys repository contains `pre-commit`_ hooks for different purposes.
Currently, these hooks are available:

* ``add-license-headers``: Add missing license headers to files by using
  `REUSE <https://reuse.software/>`_ . To use this hook, you must
  have ``REUSE`` implemented in your repository.

|

``add-license-headers`` setup
-----------------------------

Add required directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using any custom templates or licenses, copy the .reuse and LICENSES directories from this repository
into the target repository. If you are using the default Ansys template and MIT.txt license, skip this step. By default,
the hook will copy the LICENSES/MIT.txt, .reuse/templates/ansys.jinja2, and .reuse/dep5 into the target repository when
the hook runs.

The LICENSES and .reuse folders are required for the hook to run correctly. Your project should have the following layout:

 ::

   project
   ├── LICENCES
   │   └── license_name.txt
   ├── .reuse
   │   └── templates
   │       └── template_name.jinja2
   │   └── dep5
   ├── src
   ├── examples
   ├── tests
   ├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
   ├── pyproject.toml

Where ``license_name`` is the name of the license that is being used, for example, MIT.txt, and
``template_name`` is the name of the custom template being used. The jinja2 file contains the
template for the license headers that are added to the files.

Licenses that are supported by ``REUSE`` can be found in the
`spdx/license-list-data <https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/main/text>`_ repository.
Please select a license text file from that repository, and copy it to the LICENSES directory.

Configure the .reuse/dep5 file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the default template and license are being used, run the hook to acquire the
.reuse and LICENSES directories. After running the hook, if files in your project
contain headers that should not, configure the .reuse/dep5 file to match the file
structure within your repository and run the hook again.

If you are manually setting up the .reuse and LICENSES directories,
ensure the .reuse/dep5 entries match the file structure within your repository.
The dep5 file contains files & directories that should not be given license headers.

* Ensure all files and directories you want to ignore are in this file.
* See step #5 for examples of how to ignore specific files in dep5.

Set custom arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: yaml

   - repo: https://github.com/ansys/pre-commit-hooks
   rev: v0.2.0
   hooks:
   - id: add-license-headers
    args: ["--custom_copyright", "custom copyright phrase", "--custom_template", "template_name", "--custom_license", "license_name", "--ignore_license_check"]

``args`` can also be formatted as follows:

.. code:: yaml

   args:
   - --custom_copyright=custom copyright phrase
   - --custom_template=template_name
   - --custom_license=license_name
   - --ignore_license_check

* ``custom copyright phrase`` is the copyright line you want to include in the license
  header. By default, it uses ``"ANSYS, Inc. and/or its affiliates."``.
* ``template_name`` is the name of the .jinja2 file located in ``.reuse/templates/``.
  By default, it uses ``ansys``.
* ``license_name`` is the name of the license being used. For example, MIT, ECL-1.0, etc.
  To view a list of licenses that are supported by ``REUSE``, see
  https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data/tree/main/text. By default it uses ``MIT``.
* ``ignore_license_check`` is whether or not to check for the license in the header. By default,
  it is ``False``, meaning the files are checked for both the copyright and licensing information
  in the header. Add ``--ignore_license_check`` to ignore checking for licensing information
  in the files.

Specify directories to run the hook on
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the hook will run on proto files in any directory, as well as python files within
directories named ``src``, ``examples``, and ``tests``. To specify additional files and/or directories
the hook should run on, add the necessary regex to the ``files`` line in your
.pre-commit-config.yaml file:

.. code:: yaml

   - repo: https://github.com/ansys/pre-commit-hooks
     rev: v0.2.0
     hooks:
     - id: add-license-headers
       files: '(src|examples|tests|newFolder)/.*\.(py|newExtension)|\.(proto|newExtension)'

Ignore specific files or file types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two different ways to ignore specific files or file types:

In .pre-commit-config.yaml

.. code:: yaml

  - repo: https://github.com/ansys/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v0.2.0
    hooks:
    - id: add-license-headers
      exclude: |
          (?x)^(
              path/to/file1.py |
              path/to/.*\.(ts|cpp) |
              (.folder1|folder2)/.* |
              .*\.js |
              \..* |
          )$

* ``path/to/file1.py`` excludes the stated file.
* ``path/to/.*\.(ts|cpp)`` excludes all .ts and .cpp files within the ``path/to`` directory.
* ``(.folder1|folder2)/.*`` excludes directories named .folder1 and folder2.
* ``.*\.js`` excludes all .js files in all directories.
* ``\..*`` excludes all hidden files.

In .reuse/dep5

.. code:: debcontrol

  Files: path/to/file1.py
  Copyright: 2023 ANSYS, Inc. and/or its affiliates.
  License: MIT

  Files: path/to/*.py
  Copyright: 2023 ANSYS, Inc. and/or its affiliates.
  License: MIT

* ``path/to/file1.py`` excludes the stated file.
* ``path/to/*.py`` excludes all .py files in the ``path/to`` directory.

How to install
--------------

The following sections provide instructions for installing the ``ansys-pre-commit-hooks``
package in two installation modes: user and developer.

For users
^^^^^^^^^

Before installing the package, to ensure that you
have the latest version of `pip`_, run this command:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install -U pip

Then, to install the package, run this command:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install ansys-pre-commit-hooks

For developers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing the package in developer mode allows you to modify and
enhance the source code.

Before contributing to the project, ensure that you are familiar with
the `PyAnsys Developer's Guide`_.

For a developer installation, you must follow these steps:

#. Clone the repository with this command:

   .. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/ansys/pre-commit-hooks

#. Create a fresh-clean Python environment and activate it with these commands:

   .. code:: bash

      # Create a virtual environment
      python -m venv .venv

      # Activate it in a POSIX system
      source .venv/bin/activate

      # Activate it in Windows CMD environment
      .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

      # Activate it in Windows Powershell
      .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

#. Ensure that you have the latest required build system tools by
   running this command:

   .. code:: bash

      python -m pip install -U pip flit tox twine


#. Install the project in editable mode by running one of these commands:

   .. code:: bash

      # Install the minimum requirements
      python -m pip install -e .

      # Install the minimum + tests requirements
      python -m pip install -e .[tests]

      # Install the minimum + doc requirements
      python -m pip install -e .[doc]

      # Install all requirements
      python -m pip install -e .[tests,doc]

#. Verify your development installation by running this command:

   .. code:: bash

      tox


How to test it
--------------

This project takes advantage of `tox`_. This tool automates common
development tasks (similar to Makefile), but it is oriented towards
Python development.

Using ``tox``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While Makefile has rules, ``tox`` has environments. In fact, ``tox`` creates its
own virtual environment so that anything being tested is isolated from the project
to guarantee the project's integrity.

These environment commands are provided:

- **tox -e style**: Checks for coding style quality.
- **tox -e py**: Checks for unit tests.
- **tox -e py-coverage**: Checks for unit testing and code coverage.
- **tox -e doc**: Checks for successfully building the documentation.


Raw testing
^^^^^^^^^^^

If required, you can always call style commands, such as `black`_, `isort`_,
and `flake8`_, or unit testing commands, such as `pytest`_, from the command line.
However, calling these commands does not guarantee that your project is
being tested in an isolated environment, which is the reason why tools like
``tox`` exist.


A note on ``pre-commit``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The style checks take advantage of `pre-commit`_. Developers are not forced but
encouraged to install this tool by running this command:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install


Documentation
-------------

For building documentation, you can run the usual rules provided in the
`Sphinx`_ Makefile with a command that is formatted like this:

.. code:: bash

    make -C doc/ html && your_browser_name doc/html/index.html

However, the recommended way of checking documentation integrity is by
running ``tox`` with a command that is formatted like this:

.. code:: bash

    tox -e doc && your_browser_name .tox/doc_out/index.html


Distributing
------------

If you would like to create either source or wheel files, install
the building requirements and then execute the build module with these commands:

.. code:: bash

    python -m pip install .
    python -m build
    python -m twine check dist/*

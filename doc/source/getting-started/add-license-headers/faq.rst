.. dropdown:: What should the start year be if my repository was created before the current year?
    :animate: fade-in-slide-down

    If you are adding license headers to repositories that were started prior to the current year,
    add the ``--start_year`` argument with the year your first file was committed. For example,
    if ``start_year`` is 2023, the copyright statement would be
    ``Copyright (C) 2023 - 2025 ANSYS, Inc. and/or its affiliates.`` assuming the current
    year is 2025.
